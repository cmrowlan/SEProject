Project for Software Engineering Spring 2022 - Dr. Aboudja

This Student Management in this repo was developed by:
Chase Rowlan
Kyle Suder

Jusung Kang

The goal of this project was to develop an application that would allow students to view and edit their grades and enrolled courses. We utilize a .NET Web API using Entity Framework Core and MySQL database for backend services and an Angular frontend. This project was completed as a requirement of the Spring 2022 Software Engineering course at Oklahoma City University.
